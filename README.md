## Technical Stack
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI (DAX, Power Query)
* **Data Processing:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* **Data Modeling:** Star Schema architecture

## Directory Structure
* **/data:** Contains the processed retail dataset in CSV format.
* **/dashboards:** Includes the .pbix source file and static visual exports.
* **/reports:** Contains the comprehensive technical and strategic analysis report.
